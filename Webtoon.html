          of the classic Greek mythology of Hades and Persephone. It's their love story from the moment
          they first meet and features a wide range of gods and goddesses.
          Lore Olympus tackles a ton of modern-day issues and is so wonderfully drawn.

        <td>True Beauty</td>
        <td>This Webtoon is a take on Korean beauty standards.
           True horror fan, Jugyeong, is an utterly average teenage girl.
           She has acne, doesn't have double eyelids, and just doesn't see the beauty within herself.
           That is, until she binge-watches a ton of makeup tutorials and tests it on herself.
           Now the issue is letting anyone besides her immediate family see her without makeup.
           Created by Yaongyi, True Beauty was once labeled as a drama and completely read as a Korean drama show.
           But recently, the love triangle has gotten a bit heavier in the plot and the comic's genre was changed to romance.
           This series has become so popular that a TV series adaptation has since been made,
            which delighted fans as it was one of the comics that readers most wanted adapted.</td>

        Everyone in John's school for the elite has superpowers,
        it's the norm of the unOrdinary world. Everyone, that is, except for John. They call those lacking in power "cripples,"
        and they are expected to keep a low profile. Think Gossip Girl meets My Hero Academia, the rich and elite
        (with a disdain for the lower class) but they're also students with superpowers.
