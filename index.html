<h2>Plot:</h2>
<hr size="3" color="black">
<p>
  In a world where hunters, humans who possess magical abilities,
  must battle deadly monsters to protect the human race from certain annihilation,
  a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly
  endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly
  powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called
  the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability
  to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights
  against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and
  the true source of his powers.
</p>
<h2>Characters:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sung Jinwoo</li>
  <p>
    Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling.
    Originally an infamous weak E-Rank hunter, he gets the chance
    of a lifetime when he is selected as the Player of a magical
    program called the System and gains the unique ability to grow in
    strength without restraint. By taking advantage of this new power
    offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rises up to become
    humanity's greatest hunter, but also finds himself locked in a war
    that has been going on forever between the Rulers and the Monarchs,
     two groups of godlike beings who have their own agendas with mankind.
  </p>
  <li>Yoo Jinho</li>
  <p>
    Yoo Jinho (유진호) is a Korean D-Rank Hunter and Jinwoo's best friend.
    He hails from an uber-rich family and eventually becomes the vice chairman
    of Jinwoo's guild after he manages to impress the latter with his loyalty
    and commitment. Jinho also has the odd habit of dressing up in very fancy
    and expensive armor, which serves as a prominent running gag throughout the series.
  </p>
  <li>Cha Hae-In</li>
  <p>
    Cha Hae-In (차해인) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter who specializes in swordsmanship
    and the only female S-Rank in the country. She has an odd condition that causes
    other hunters to smell foul to her and eventually develops romantic feelings
    for Jinwoo after witnessing him in action and discovering that he is the only hunter
    she has ever met who actually smells nice.
  </p>
  <li>Sung Jinah</li>
  <p>
    Sung Jinah (성진아) is Jinwoo's teenage sister. Unlike her brother,
    she is a completely normal human with no magical abilities whatsoever.
